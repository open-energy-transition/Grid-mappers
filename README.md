# Oh my Grid!

Energy Sources from fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. For mitigating away from fossil energy sources the extension and modernization of the electrical grid is considered as one of the main bottlenecks. 

Despite the urgent need to expand the global electrical grid, the industry has not been able to define open data standards for the cross-border exchange of transmission grid routing data and specifications. Over the last years OpenStreetMap has established itself as the unofficial de facto standard for academia and industry to analyse transmission and distribution grids across borders and nations. Especially for developing countries the quality and coverage of grid data is not sufficient. Closing the gab is key for climate mitation as has been stated by International Energy Agency in their latest report as a key recommendation: 
> Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.

## How you can get involved?
Your support can make a significant impact on closing the data gap in the electricity grid. The Oh-my-Grid initiative will empower you! Are you good at online research? Do you like programming? Do you want to recognise power towers and other electrical infrastructure on satellite images? Do you want to use this data for a climate mitigation or the electrification of rural communities? We can help you find the right contribution for your skills and experience:

⚠️ **If you're eager to get started with transmission grid mapping in OpenStreetMap, check out the [Grid Mapping Starter Kit](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/grid-mapping-starter-kit) and [our community discord channel](https://discord.gg/a5znpdFWfD).** ⚠️
