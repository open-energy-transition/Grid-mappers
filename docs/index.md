    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Energy from fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor to climate change, accounting for over 75 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigating away from fossil energy sources requires the rapid extension and modernization of the electrical grid, which is currently one of the main bottlenecks to decarbonising our energy.</p>
    <p>Despite the urgent need to expand the global electricity grid, the industry has been unable to establish an open data standard for the exchange of transmission grid routing data and specifications across borders. In recent years, OpenStreetMap has established itself as the unofficial de facto standard in academia and industry for cross-border transmission and distribution grid data. For developing countries in particular, the quality and coverage of grid data is inadequate. Closing this gap is not only essential for providing stable energy supply to rural communities, it is also key to mitigating climate change, a key recommendation of the International Energy Agency's latest report:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.

    <p>That's why <a href="https://openenergytransition.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Energy Transition</a> has launched this open initiative, working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04550-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open digital twin of the European grid</a>, but also to expand the global coverage of the transmission grid in OpenStreetMap from around 70% to 98% over the next three years.</p>
